# Rock-Paper-Scissor

Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Development

Rock-Paper-Scissors is a simple hand game played between two participants, often used for decision-making or for fun. Each player simultaneously selects one of three options that incluides either Rock, Paper, or Scissors. The game follows three basic rules which is , Rock crushes Scissors, Scissors cut Paper, and Paper covers Rock. If both players make the same choice, the game results in a tie. The Rock Paper & Scissors game developed had underwent several iterations to enhance and improve the final output of the game. Each Iteration had a specific objective focused development to aid the progress of the game development into a succesful working project wihout bugs or errors. Bugs and errors within each iteration where identified and solved to ensure a smooth user-friendly experience.

# Branching and Merging Strategy

We used a feature-based branching strategy for better project organization.

- **Branches:** Each iteration (iteration-1, iteration-2, etc.) was developed in a separate branch to maintain a clean main branch.
- **Merging:** After testing each iteration, we merged it into the main branch.
- **Tagging:** We used version tags (v1.0, v2.0, etc.) to mark major development milestones.

This approach ensured organized development and easy rollback if needed.

# Iteration 1: Basic Game Setup
Features added:

-A simple interface with three selectable options: Rock, Paper, and Scissors.

-JavaScript function to determine the winner based on standard Rock-Paper-Scissors rules.

-Random selection mechanism for the computer’s choice.

-Color-coded result display: Green for player wins, red for losses.

# Iteration 2: Adding a Scoreboard
Features added:

-A scoreboard to track wins for both the player and the computer.

-JavaScript function to update the scoreboard dynamically after each round.

-When player wins player score increases by one.

-When player loses computer score increases by one.

-When the result is a tie , the score remains as it is for both.

-Enhanced styling to make the scoreboard more visible and appealing.

# Iteration 3: Improved UI with GUI integration & Multi-Page like Layout
Features added:

Replacement of emojis with actual images for Rock, Paper, and Scissors to improve user experience.

-A two-page layout like experience by hiding the elements that operates such as :

First page for player selection.

Second page to display the result on who was the winner

-"Play Again" button to continue the game and for a smoother game flow.

-CSS animations for better visual appeal to avoid any jittery effect while clicking the buttons.

-Optimized JavaScript to ensure smooth transitions between game states.

# How to download the file and run on your computer
1. After enter the repository main page via the url.
2. Under main branch access the "<>Code" button to download the zip file.
3. Use your personal compiler (eg. Visual Studio Code) to view and edit the available files to your personal preferences that may include changing the layout, pictures and etc.
4. Then, save the changes to view the update.
5. If you like the original version of the source code you can proceed to run the code without any changes.

# Conclusion
Through an iterative development process, the Rock-Paper-Scissors game evolved from a basic prototype to a fully functional, engaging, and visually appealing web application. The incorporation of a scoreboard, improved UI, and better game flow significantly enhanced user experience.

# Kanban Explanation
For our Rock, Paper, Scissors game project, we used Trello Kanban board to plan, organize, and track our tasks. Our Kanban board has five primary columns including Backlog, To Do, In Progress, Testing, and Done.

# How we used the Kanban board
We began by listing all the necessary tasks required to complete the project in the "Backlog" column together with the due dates for each tasks, and assigned each task for our group members. Then, we moved several tasks that must be initiated first to the “To Do” column, including “research game logic and rules for Rock, Paper, Scissors game” and “identify required functions and classes for the game”. Later, group members chose tasks from “To Do” column and moved them to “In Progress” when they started working on them. Upon completing a task, it was moved to “Testing” column for review, testing and debugging to ensure that the code was error-free and performed as expected. In the end, fully tested and validated tasks were moved to “Done” column, indicating their completion.

# Effectiveness of the Kanban board
Utilizing Trello’s Kanban board gave some significant benefits in this assignment. Firstly, it helped us to improve task organization. It is because tasks were categorized efficiently, making them easier to track our progress from the beginning stage. Moreover, team collaboration became clear and effective as each member were assigned tasks equally, thus ensures accountability. In addition to that, due to the due dates we set, it helped us stay on schedule, leading to better time management. Lastly, the Kanban board helped us to maintain a smooth development process since we followed the structure movement of tasks from “Backlog” to “Done”.

# Challenges
The first challenge we faced was task dependencies because some tasks relied on completion of other tasks. This caused delays when the earlier required parts were not finished on time. Furthermore, during the testing and debugging stage, we were required to identify and fix bugs in all three iterations, which leads to additional time-consuming in our progress. Lastly, when we needed to change certain task’s due dates, Trello sometimes restricted editing past due dates. Thus, making it difficult to amend the due dates when needed.
